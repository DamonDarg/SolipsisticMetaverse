Concept
Solipsistic Metaverse is an architectural blueprint for creating highly efficient virtual environments where the existence of objects and the activity of non-player characters (NPCs) are directly dependent on the attention of the user-observer. It is not a simulation of reality in its entirety, but a narrative-driven model optimized to create a believable illusion of a holistic world with minimal computational overhead.

How it works
1. On-Demand Rendering/Simulation
The user field is the virtual world environment limited by the immediate presence of the user, which is simulated by the processor. (visualization, physics, NPC)
The required integrity is a simulation of an environment invisible to the user that affects the visible environment. (what happens behind your back or around the corner)
Outside the user's field of vision, the world is not processed by the GPU, but exists as dynamic data structures.
Visualization is based on simple 3D models with generative filling and texturing, and unique 3D models and assets.
The environment is generated based on user requests using specialized AI. A simple 3D model of the main buildings and landscapes is used as the framework of the world, as well as their text description.
Unique objects are 3D models and decals created by the user or NPC. Information about them is stored in the database and is taken into account during visualization. Depending on the conditions of the environment and time, these artifacts can change (for example, rust or crack). Over time, some artifacts can be completely removed from the visualization process due to their degradation.

3. The hierarchy of NPC consciousness and the Chronicler system
NPCs do not have a permanent "consciousness". Their visualization and activity (connection of AI as their consciousness) is activated only when they enter the user's field.
The level of the connected AI consciousness of the NPC depends on direct interaction with the user. (the stronger the interaction, the higher the NPC AI)
Outside the user's field, the NPC's life is simulated by a high-level specialized AI - the "Chronicler".

The "Chronicler" is an AI that:

Generates a consistent history of the world (past events, relationships between NPCs).
Based on this history, personal "memories" are created for each NPC, which are used when interacting with the user.
For the NPC, these memories are absolutely real, forming their personality and motivation.
When activated (visualizations), the NPC does not notice the transition from an inactive state to an active one. It begins to perceive the virtual space around it as a continuation of its life. The AI ​​connected to it will perceive its environment and available subjects as a user (in a simplified version). Its reactions will correspond to past experience, embedded character and past memories.

3. Difference between NPCs
The difference between minor and major NPCs is not in the "AI power", but in the volume and complexity of the biography generated for them by the Chronicler.
Background NPC: Has a short, local history (was born, works, has simple goals).
Main NPC: Has a more complex biography (especially experience interacting with the user), which allows him to conduct complex dialogues and make non-trivial decisions.

Project goal
This repository is an open concept. The author understands the complexity of practical implementation and does not have the resources to implement it.

Goal: To share this architectural idea with the community for free in the hope that it:
Will be useful for developers of virtual reality engines and metaverses.
Will inspire researchers to develop principles of effective simulation.
Will be used (in whole or in part) in future projects to overcome fundamental performance problems.

Why is this important?
This approach offers a solution to the key problems of metaverses:

Performance: Dramatically reduces CPU/GPU load by eliminating the need for total simulation.

Scalability: Allows for creating almost infinitely large and detailed worlds.

Plausibility: Creates a social fabric of the world similar to that of humans (people have different amounts of knowledge and experience).

Contribution
Discussion, criticism, development of the idea, and forks are welcome. If this concept inspires you to create a prototype, research, or article, attribution would be a nice gesture, but is not required by the MIT license.

This concept was developed in collaboration with a neural network assistant for structuring ideas.
